# Find your Rewst instance region

Rewst hosts instances in multiple regions. While this is chosen during the implementation phase, you can always find which region you're in by simply looking at the URL of Rewst as it appears in your browser.

Add the following as a table.\
[https://app.rewst.io](https://app.rewst.io/) | US\
[https://app.eu.rewst.io](https://app.eu.rewst.io/) | UK\
[https://app.rewst.eu](https://app.rewst.eu/) | DE\
[https://app.rewst.asia](https://app.rewst.asia/) | AU

For example, the below URL belongs to an US instance of Rewst.
